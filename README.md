Online Tracking mechanism for tracking infringement content

This tool is useful for finding whether the uploaded image or video is unique and a similar file does not exist in the database.
If the file is unique, it will be added to the database and if the uploaded file is not unique, it will be shown with which file it is matching and it will be deleted.
